## Docker

### Installation

**Build this image**

```bash
docker build -t larowlan/tl .
```

NOTE: Until we have builds on the Docker Hub.

**Bash alias**

The following will make your `tl` cli command appear like it's running native, but it's not! it's running in
a container!

Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file.

```bash
alias tl='docker run -v $HOME:/root -it --rm larowlan/tl'
```

**Run**

You can now follow the same steps as above for installation.

eg.

```bash
tl install
```
